## Local Density (LD) potential

This is a mean-field manybody potential useful for reproducing manybody effects in a computationally efficient manner in coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the past it has been succesfully applied in constructing CG models of solvent-free polymer folding and liquid-liquid phase behavior. Here, we present its implementation as a LAMMPS pair style, drawing heavily from the pair_eam styles.
