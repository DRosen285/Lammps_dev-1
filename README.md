###### USER-LD

Provides the Local Density (LD) potential which is coarse-grained (CG) MD mean-field manybody potential useful for reproducing manybody effects in bottom up CG MD simulations.

###### reorder_REMD_traj

Utility tool written in python to reorder Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) trajectories by temperature which is not done automatically by LAMMPS
